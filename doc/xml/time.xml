    <para>In the following, the GNSS Time Scales are described, according to
      RINEX v303.</para>
    <para>The time system identifiers used in RINEX files are:

    <para>Apart from the small errors in the realizations of the different time systems, the relations between

      </table>
      Where:
      &#916;tLS = Delta time between GPS and UTC due to leap seconds, as transmitted by the GPS satellites in the almanac
      &#916;tLS<subscript>BDS</subscript> = Delta time between BDT and UTC due to leap seconds, as transmitted by the BDS satellites in the almanac
      (See BDS-SIS-ICD-2.0 Section 5.2.4.17)</para>
    <section><title>GPS Time</title>
      <para>GPS time runs, apart from small differences (&lt;&lt; 1 microsecond), parallel to UTC. But it is a
        continuous time scale, i.e. it does not insert any leap seconds. GPS time is usually expressed in
        GPS weeks and GPS seconds past 00:00:00 (midnight) Saturday/Sunday. GPS time started with
        week zero at 00:00:00 UT (midnight) on January 6, 1980. Between 1980 and 2012 16 leap
        seconds have been introduced into UTC.</para>
      <para>The GPS week is transmitted by the satellites as a 10 bit number. It has a roll-over after week
        1023. The first roll-over happened on August 22, 1999, 00:00:00 GPS time.</para>
      <para>In order to avoid ambiguities, the GPS week reported in the RINEX navigation message files is a
        continuous number without roll-over, i.e. ...1023, 1024, 1025, ...</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>QZSS Time</title>
      <para>QZSS runs on QZSS time, which conforms to UTC Japan Standard Time Group (JSTG) time
        and the offset with respect to GPS time is controlled. The following properties apply to the
        QZSS time definition: the length of one second is defined with respect to International Atomic
        Time (TAI); QZSS time is aligned with GPS time (offset from TAI by integer seconds); the
        QZSS week number is defined with respect to the GPS week.</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>GLONASS Time</title>
      <para>GLONASS is basically running on UTC (or, more precisely, GLONASS system time linked to
        UTC(SU)), i.e. the time tags are given in UTC and not GPS time. It is not a continuous time, i.e.
        it introduces the same leap seconds as UTC. The reported GLONASS time has the same hours as
        UTC and not UTC+3 h as the original GLONASS System Time!</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>Galileo Time</title>
      <para>Galileo runs on Galileo System Time (GST), which is, apart from small differences (tens of
        nanoseconds), nearly identical to GPS time:
        <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
          <listitem><para>The Galileo week starts at midnight Saturday/Sunday at the same second as the GPS week</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>The GST week as transmitted by the satellites is a 12 bit value with a roll-over after week
              4095. The GST week started at zero at the first roll-over of the broadcast GPS week after
              1023, i.e. at Sun, 22-Aug-1999 00:00:00 GPS time.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        In order to remove possible misunderstandings and ambiguities, the Galileo week reported in the
        RINEX navigation message files is a continuous number without roll-over, i.e., ...4095,4096,4097,... 
        and it is aligned to the GPS week.</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>BeiDou (BDS) Time</title>
      <para>The BDS Time (BDT) System is a continuous timekeeping system, with its length of second 
        being an SI second. BDT zero time started at 00:00:00 UTC on January 1<superscript>st</superscript>, 2006 (GPS week
        1356) therefore BDT is 14 seconds behind GPS time. BDT is synchronized with UTC within 100
        nanoseconds (modulo 1 second).</para>
      <para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
          <listitem><para>The BDT week starts at midnight Saturday/Sunday</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>The BDT week is transmitted by the satellites as a 13 bit number. It has a roll-over after
              week 8191. In order to avoid ambiguities, the BDT week reported in the RINEX
              navigation message files is a continuous number without roll-over, i.e. ...8191, 8192,
              8193, ...</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section><title>IRNSS Time</title>
      <para>IRNSS runs on Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System Time (IRNSST). The IRNSST
        start epoch is 00:00:00 on Sunday August 22<superscript>nd</superscript>, 1999, which corresponds to August 21<superscript>st</superscript>, 1999
        23:59:47 UTC (same time as the first GPS week roll over). Seconds of week are counted from
        00:00:00 IRNSST hours Saturday/Sunday midnight which also corresponds to the start of the
        GPS week. Week numbers are consecutive from the start time and will roll over after week 1023
        (at the same time as GPS and QZSS roll over).</para>
