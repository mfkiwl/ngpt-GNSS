    <para>In the following, the GNSS Time Scales are described, according to

      </table>
      Where:
      &#916;tLS = Delta time between GPS and UTC due to leap seconds, as transmitted by the GPS satellites in the almanac
      &#916;tLS<subscript>BDS</subscript> = Delta time between BDT and UTC due to leap seconds, as transmitted by the BDS satellites in the almanac
      (See BDS-SIS-ICD-2.0 Section 5.2.4.17)</para>
    <section><title>GPS Time</title>
      <para>GPS time runs, apart from small differences (&lt;&lt; 1 microsecond), parallel to UTC. But it is a
        continuous time scale, i.e. it does not insert any leap seconds. GPS time is usually expressed in
        GPS weeks and GPS seconds past 00:00:00 (midnight) Saturday/Sunday. GPS time started with
        week zero at 00:00:00 UT (midnight) on January 6, 1980. Between 1980 and 2012 16 leap
        seconds have been introduced into UTC.</para>
      <para>The GPS week is transmitted by the satellites as a 10 bit number. It has a roll-over after week
        1023. The first roll-over happened on August 22, 1999, 00:00:00 GPS time.</para>
      <para>In order to avoid ambiguities, the GPS week reported in the RINEX navigation message files is a
        continuous number without roll-over, i.e. ...1023, 1024, 1025, ...</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>QZSS Time</title>
      <para>QZSS runs on QZSS time, which conforms to UTC Japan Standard Time Group (JSTG) time
        and the offset with respect to GPS time is controlled. The following properties apply to the
        QZSS time definition: the length of one second is defined with respect to International Atomic
        Time (TAI); QZSS time is aligned with GPS time (offset from TAI by integer seconds); the
        QZSS week number is defined with respect to the GPS week.</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>GLONASS Time</title>
      <para>GLONASS is basically running on UTC (or, more precisely, GLONASS system time linked to
        UTC(SU)), i.e. the time tags are given in UTC and not GPS time. It is not a continuous time, i.e.
        it introduces the same leap seconds as UTC. The reported GLONASS time has the same hours as
        UTC and not UTC+3 h as the original GLONASS System Time!</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>Galileo Time</title>
      <para>Galileo runs on Galileo System Time (GST), which is, apart from small differences (tens of
        nanoseconds), nearly identical to GPS time:
        <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
          <listitem><para>The Galileo week starts at midnight Saturday/Sunday at the same second as the GPS week</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>The GST week as transmitted by the satellites is a 12 bit value with a roll-over after week
              4095. The GST week started at zero at the first roll-over of the broadcast GPS week after
              1023, i.e. at Sun, 22-Aug-1999 00:00:00 GPS time.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        In order to remove possible misunderstandings and ambiguities, the Galileo week reported in the
        RINEX navigation message files is a continuous number without roll-over, i.e., ...4095,4096,4097,... 
        and it is aligned to the GPS week.</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>BeiDou (BDS) Time</title>
      <para>The BDS Time (BDT) System is a continuous timekeeping system, with its length of second 
        being an SI second. BDT zero time started at 00:00:00 UTC on January 1<superscript>st</superscript>, 2006 (GPS week
        1356) therefore BDT is 14 seconds behind GPS time. BDT is synchronized with UTC within 100
        nanoseconds (modulo 1 second).</para>
      <para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
          <listitem><para>The BDT week starts at midnight Saturday/Sunday</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>The BDT week is transmitted by the satellites as a 13 bit number. It has a roll-over after
              week 8191. In order to avoid ambiguities, the BDT week reported in the RINEX
              navigation message files is a continuous number without roll-over, i.e. ...8191, 8192,
              8193, ...</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section><title>IRNSS Time</title>
      <para>IRNSS runs on Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System Time (IRNSST). The IRNSST
        start epoch is 00:00:00 on Sunday August 22<superscript>nd</superscript>, 1999, which corresponds to August 21<superscript>st</superscript>, 1999
        23:59:47 UTC (same time as the first GPS week roll over). Seconds of week are counted from
        00:00:00 IRNSST hours Saturday/Sunday midnight which also corresponds to the start of the
        GPS week. Week numbers are consecutive from the start time and will roll over after week 1023
        (at the same time as GPS and QZSS roll over).</para>

  <section xml:id="chap_tm_02"><title>Astronomical Time Scales</title>
    <section><title>Atomic time: TAI</title>
      <para>The unit of proper time is the SI second, defined as “the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the 
        radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state
        of the caesium 133 atom”, the latter being at 0 K and in zero magnetic field. The duration was
        chosen to match the existing astronomical time scale, and is consequently a fossil of the solar
        day length during the 19th century. The SI second is the unit of TAI and UTC, and is inherited
        by the relativistic time scales TCG and TCB.</para>
      <para>TAI is a laboratory time scale, independent of astronomical phenomena apart from having been
        synchronized to solar time when first introduced (at the start of 1958). It is realized through
        a changing population of about 200 high-precision atomic clocks held at standards institutes
        in various countries. There is an elaborate process of continuous intercomparison, leading to a
        weighted average of all the clocks involved. TAI is close to proper time for an observer on the
        geoid, and is an appropriate choice for terrestrial applications where continuity through UTC
        leap seconds (see 3.5.1) is a requirement. It is not disseminated directly as a time service, but
        can easily be realized from GPS or UTC. 5 The SOFA software supports transformations between
        TAI and three other time scales, namely UTC, UT1 and TT.</para>
    </section>
    <section><title>Solar Time: UT1 and UTC</title>
      <para>UT1 (or plain UT) is the modern equivalent of mean solar time, and is really an angle rather than
        time in the physics sense. Originally defined in terms of a point in the sky called “the fictitious
        mean Sun”, UT1 is now defined through its relationship with Earth rotation angle (formerly
        through sidereal time). Because the Earth’s rotation rate is slightly irregular—for geophysical
        reasons—and is gradually decreasing, the UT1 second is not precisely matched to the SI second.
        This makes UT1 itself unsuitable for use as a time scale in physics applications. However, some
        applications do require UT1, such as pointing a telescope or antenna at a celestial target, delay
        calculations in interferometers, and diurnal aberration, parallax and Doppler corrections.</para>
      <para>UTC is a compromise between the demands of precise timekeeping and the desire to maintain
        the current relationship between civil time and daylight. Since its introduction in 1960, UTC
        has been kept roughly in step with UT1 by a variety of adjustments agreed in advance and
        then carried out in a coordinated manner by the providers of time services—hence the name.
        Though rate changes were used until 1972, since then all such adjustments have been made by
        occasionally inserting a whole second, called a leap second, a procedure that can be thought of
        as stopping the UTC clock for a second to let the Earth catch up. Leap seconds are discussed
        below.</para>
      <para>To obtain UT1 starting from UTC, it is necessary to look up the value of &#916;UT1 = UT1−UTC for
        the date concerned in tables published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems 
        Service (IERS); this is then added to the UTC. The quantity UT1−UTC, which typically
        changes by 1-2 ms per day, can be obtained only by observation, principally very long baseline
        interferometry (VLBI) using extragalactic radio sources, though seasonal effects are present and
        the IERS listings are able to predict some way into the future with adequate accuracy for most
        applications.</para>
