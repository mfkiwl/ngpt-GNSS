/** \details  This class holds a GNSS receiver. Any receiver is represented
 *            by an array of chars of maximum receiver_details::receiver_max_chars 
 *            elements. One space between manufacturer name and model name.
 *
 *            The class has a (single) member holding a \c cstring, representing
 *            the model name. The model name can be of maximum 
 *            receiver_details::receiver_max_chars characters. One more char is
 *            reserved (the last one) to add the '\0' character. So the size of the
 *            member char-array is actually receiver_details::receiver_max_chars + 1.
 *
 *            Never mess with the last character! You can't if you use the
 *            interface.
 *
 *            Allowed in model name: 
 *            -# 'A-Z'
 *            -# '0-9' 
 *            -# space and 
 *            -# '-_+'.
 *            Example: 'ASHTECH 3DF-XXIV', 'TPS ODYSSEY_E'.
 *
 * \todo      -# Sould the move constructors be enabled ?
 *
 * \bug       -# The function validate does not work as expected 
 *               \see Receiver::validate().
 *               For example the following: 
 *               \code{.cpp}
 *               Receiver rec {" GEODETIC III L1/L2   "};
 *               bool ok = rec.validate();
 *               \endcode
 *               Will set \c ok to \c true , even though the character \c '/'
 *               is not allowed.
